## Contributing

Thank you for deciding to look into this project. This project is meant to provide a learning experience with CLI node.js projects, game development and open source contributions.

## How to contribute?

You can chose either one of the following..
- **Test**: Test and report a bug through the issue tracker.
- **Fix**: Pick a bug through the issue tracker and work on it.
- **Plan**: Add enhancement for future versions in the issue tracker.
- **Create**: Work on planned enhancements.
- **Document**: Improve or fix documentation for either the code and/or README files.

Still haven't decided? Go through the issue tracker and look for tags `help wanted` or `good first issue`. 

If you have decided to **Fix** or **Create** something: 
- leave a comment (so I can assign it to you)
- fork it
- work/discuss about the issue
- send a PR 

That's it. ðŸŽ‰

If you decided to **Test**, **Plan** or **Document** then simply create a new issue with appropriate tags like `bug`, `enhancement` or `documentation`. For simple typo fixes just send a PR directly.

Please also note that all PRs will go through testing so _be patient_ and _mindful_ about when submitting PRs. It is always better to test yourself to avoid any delays and also be ready make changes if the testing fails or further any changes are requested.
