- When you move to a tile, it could be a monster, boss, weather/special or a friend!
- When in a fight, the winner is decided by randomness.
    - taking your **POWER** and the monster/boss **POWER**
    - Chance formula of you winning the fight is : GERALT'S **POWER**/(MOSTER/BOSS **POWER** + GERALT'S **POWER**)
        - Example, you encounter 4 **POWER** monster, so your chance of winning would be *(15/4+15)\*100* that is *79%*, so take a random number generator, and hit the generate button, if the number is lower than or equal to 79 then you win, else the monster wins.
- When a friend joins your party, thier **POWER** is added to your power for next fights.
